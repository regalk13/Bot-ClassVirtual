This is a bot that, with the help of ppandas, reads an .xlsx file, looks at what classes you have and automatically enters them. To zoom use pyautogui using the data to find the buttons, in meet use webbowser also from this library and with keyboards preprogram 'Tap' and 'Enter'.

At the moment it only works with these apps but soon I will add to Microsoft Teams, I hope you like it and can use it...
